        </p>
        <p class="text-base mb-4" ><span class="font-bold">Device Changes:</span> If you change your device, there is a risk that your Virtual Items may not be restored. PVP Inc. does not offer an account system or a way to back up Virtual Items. While Apple and Google provide options to restore purchases through their respective platforms, PVP Inc. is not responsible for ensuring successful restoration or for any loss of Virtual Items that occurs due to device changes or platform limitations. <span class="font-bold"> By purchasing Virtual Items, you acknowledge and accept this risk.</span>

You further acknowledge that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items, regardless of whether your loss of license under these TOS was voluntary or involuntary.</span>  The foregoing does not affect your rights under applicable law, including those you may have based on the legal guarantee of conformity described in Section “Disclaimer”.

        <p class="text-base mb-4 font-bold" >If you ask for your personal data to be deleted as described in PVP Inc.’s Privacy Notice, you will permanently forfeit all of your Virtual Items without the right to refund, as PVP Inc. will no longer be able associate such Virtual Items with you.

        <p class="text-base mb-4">You agree that all sales by us to you of Virtual Items are final, that we will not refund any transaction once it has been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are resident in the European Economic Area, you have the right to withdraw from the purchase and the associated purchase terms (which may be set out by the applicable payment intermediary for the purchase, for example Google or Apple) within fourteen (14) calendar days. However, as a resident in the European Economic Area, you agree that when you purchase Virtual Items from us, you request immediate performance and that you understand this means you will lose your statutory right to withdraw from your purchase and the associated terms once you access and use the Virtual Items. If you are resident in the United Kingdom, when you purchase Virtual Items and we immediately supply the Virtual Items to you, you will be asked to acknowledge that this means you will lose your statutory right to withdraw from your purchase and the associated terms.

        <p class="text-base mb-4">For the avoidance of doubt, you agree that when you purchase Virtual Items from us, you request immediate performance and that you understand this means you will lose your statutory right to withdraw from your purchase and the applicable terms once you access and use the Virtual Items.

        <p class="text-base mb-4">To withdraw from the purchase of a license to a Virtual Item or a Service, we recommend contacting our third-party retailer (Google or Apple) directly for information on your options for withdrawal.

			<section class="my-8">
				<h2 class="mb-4 font-semibold">10. Availability, Compatibility, and Changes to the Services</h2>
				<p class="text-base mb-4">
					PVP does not guarantee that the Services are available at all times or will continue to be available in the
					future. The
					Services may be temporarily unavailable due to technical issues or maintenance related reasons, which may
					occur on a
					scheduled or unscheduled basis. Furthermore, the Services or parts thereof may be designed to be available
					only for a
					limited time (e.g. when content is seasonal or early access is provided to a development version of a game),
					or their
					life cycle may be affected by technological developments or changes in consumer behavior. Accordingly, PVP
					reserves the
					right to stop offering and/or supporting the Services or parts thereof (e.g. a game or a feature of a game) at
					any time,
					at which point your license to use the Services or such parts thereof will be terminated automatically.  In such an event, unless otherwise required by applicable law, PVP does not have to provide refunds for the Services or any Virtual Items. Where
					appropriate, PVP will take reasonable measures to provide advance notice when any Services or parts thereof
					are
					discontinued. However, PVP may limit, suspend or terminate the Services or parts thereof without notice, and
					take
					technical and legal steps to prevent you from accessing the Services, if PVP believes you or any other user(s)
					are
					causing a risk of legal liability or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or are not
					acting in
					accordance with the letter or spirit of these TOS.
				</p>
				<p class="text-base mb-4">
					The Services may have limited compatibility across different devices and operating systems. You are
					responsible for
					verifying that the Services are compatible with your device and its operating system. Generally, more
					information
					regarding compatibility requirements is available at the point of first use or download (e.g. in the relevant
					app
					store).
				</p>
				<p class="text-base mb-4">
					The Services are intended to evolve over time. Accordingly, PVP may change, manage, modify, or update the
					Services or
					parts thereof (including, but not limited to, Virtual Items) from time to time. This may result in content or
					features
					being added, removed, or modified (e.g. gameplay modes or areas being added or removed or Virtual Items having
					their
					appearance or power altered). PVP may, at its sole discretion, make any such changes as it believes to be
					necessary to
					maintain and improve the Services, including, but not limited to, introducing, modifying, or removing game
					content and
					features according to PVP’s development roadmap, adapting to new technologies, reflecting changes to PVP’s
					agreements
					with third parties, preventing abuse or technical issues, and addressing any legal, safety, or regulatory
					requirements.
					When changes are made to the Services, you may be required to download and install an update to continue using
					them. If
					you do not, you may be unable to access or use the Services or parts thereof (e.g. online play and features
					may only be
					available to those who are using the latest version of a game).

				<p class="text-base mb-4">
					Some jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers such as those set forth above; thus, the above terms may not apply
